    <h1>My Favorite Places to Visit!</h1>
    <h2>I love to travel!</h2>
    <p><strong>Antartica</strong> is one of my most favorite places to visit during the winter because it's just the right temperature!</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley">Death Valley</a> was my greatest adventure yet! I really recommend it because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I had a great time and would go again!</p>
